This Weather App project made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

This app is not meant for any commercial use by any means and is built for educational and learning purposes only.

The weather report is fetched from https://openweathermap.org/ which delivers proper data most of the time but may posses some "incorrect" data at times. Long story short its not 100% accurate !

The API key for this project is a temporary key and hence might not work in the future. https://openweathermap.org/ provides free api keys upon account creation and can be used if needed for permanent use !
